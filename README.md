( VIP server link)
Well, this explanation shall prove to be straightforward. Your task entails the simple act of duplicating a Roblox (VIP) link, subsequently pasting it into the designated text box. Following this, you need to engage the button's activation, and lo and behold, you shall find yourself within the realm of your UWP, which stands for the Microsoft iteration of Roblox. Should this process fail to yield the expected outcome, it is possible that you are dealing with an expired link or may need to direct your attention to your default applications.

Step 1:
go to your Default apps then,Begin by scrolling downward until the point at which you encounter the option denoted as "Select default applications by protocol." Proceed to select this option.

Step 2:
Continue your scrolling until the appearance of "Roblox" (URL: Roblox) captures your attention. Admittedly, comprehending this step might pose a minor challenge, yet I assure you, with a modicum of effort, it can be deciphered. Here, the objective is to designate the Microsoft version as the default application, a process that involves making a choice between two versions. Naturally, for our present endeavor, the Microsoft iteration shall be the preferred selection. Once this decision is made, your journey is virtually complete.

And now, you may be intrigued as to how this extension was fashioned (a relatively undemanding task).
